# EEG-Anxiety-Detection-Python-script

Python script for detecting anxiety from EEG signals

The database is in .csv format and consists of 322 rows and 23 043 columns. The number of rows indicates the number of EEG signals. The first 23 040 columns represent the signal samples and the last 3 columns represent the signal name (id + source electrode) and the 2 labels corresponding to the diagnosis obtained from two different tests, SAM and HAM-A.
The original .mat files used to obtain the final database were also provided, as well as the Matlab script that does this.
However, only the Python script and the .csv database are required to run the application.
